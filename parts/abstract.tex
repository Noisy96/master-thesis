\textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}

Blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across an entire network of computers. This technology's enthusiasts believe that cryptocurrencies are only a fraction of what the blockchain will eventually yield to our future societies.\medskip

One very prominent and potential application of the blockchain is voting. Voting is one of the very ancient democratic processes, being a very efficient system, voting is still being practiced today, however, we believe that there's still room for improvement.

The goal of this work is to propose a new decentralized voting system and create a proof-of-concept using the Ethereum Blockchain, capable of launching an election, casting votes and displaying results, all while ensuring transparency, anonymity, security and above all the correctness of the results.\medskip

Throughout this work, we explored the Blockchain development ecosystem and other related scientific works, then we proposed our system. We also managed to carry the implementation of our proof-of-concept to a stage where its feasibility became very apparent.\bigskip

\textbf{Keywords:} Voting, Smart contract, Blockchain, Ethereum, Decentralized.
