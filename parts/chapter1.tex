\section{Background}
As the hype surrounding bitcoin is slowly waning, the industry is becoming more and more interested in its underlying technology: the blockchain. Now, proponents claim blockchain technology to be one of the most important new technologies of our time, about to take society by storm, and bitcoin served as the first, most thorough and complete proof of concept. In fact, Marc Andreessen, founder of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and one of the most influential members of Silicon Valley, claimed in a New York Times article that the invention of the blockchain is as important and influential as the creation of the Internet itself\cite{andreessenWhyBitcoinMatters1390323270}.\smallskip

Along with assets registry, secure sharing of medical data and supply chain and logitstics monitoring, electronic voting is one of the most prominent potential applications for the surging blockchain technology.

Blockchain voting cannot be understood without first understanding what is voting and what is blockchain technology. So according to Oxford English dictionary voting is \textit{"a formal indication of a choice between two or more candidates or courses of action, expressed typically through a ballot or a show of hands"} and a blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a secure and ever-growing ledger of records (known as blocks), allowing for the creation of a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across an entire network of computers.
